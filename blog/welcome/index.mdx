Welcome to my little corner of the internet you've somehow stumbled upon. 
I'm not sure what all this will develop into, but we'll see what happens.

# Expectations
I might as well set some early expectations I have for this website.

First and foremost, I plan to use this space as a placeholder to support my self hosted services.
That way, there is some home page I can pair with whatever else I decide to self host in the future.

Second, *potentially* writing blog posts about projects I've worked on or discussing up and coming technologies.
Thinking about it, I'll probably have a series in the future outlining my homelab as it develops.
For now, see [here](/blog/homelab) for the curent state of my homelab.
